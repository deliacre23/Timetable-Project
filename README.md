This is a Java application that I made for my Advanced Programming Methods Course which allows the conception of a timetable for faculties in a university using:

-  feature driven development methodology (first did CRUD operations and associations between classes, then added data validation, exceptions, tests using JUnit and some reports about the data using Java Streams, then added a user interface using JavaFX)

- the OOP paradigm

- layered architecture 

- for data access: text files, binary files and databases
